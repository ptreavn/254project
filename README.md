# About the Project

Anime Recommendation System is a Python script that allow users to input an anime title id as indexed in
our scraped from MAL dataset and give recommendations based on cosine similarity.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo

# Usage

`python ./anime.py --number_of_recs <number> --anime_id <id number> --in_list <input file name> --out_list <output file name>`

- number_of_recs is optional, it changes the number of recommendations you may want for each anime
- anime_id is NOT optional, this is the id of the anime you want recommendations for
- in_list is optional, this is a txt file with multiple ids of animes that you want recommendations for
  > The format of the txt file should be the ids followed by a space e.g. "id id id" _or_ one id per line
- out_list is optional, this is a txt file that you may want your recommendations to be outputted too, default will create and append to file "anime.txt"
